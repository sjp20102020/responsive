        <header><h3>UK Workplace issues</h3></header>
        Bullying in the workplace is growing, with many people too afraid to speak up about it, according to the conciliation service, Acas.
        Over the last year, Acas said it had received about 20,000 calls about harassment and bullying at work.
        Some callers to its helpline had even considered committing suicide.
        In a consultation paper, it said businesses need to take the issue much more seriously and to improve anti-bullying policies.
        The chair of Acas, Sir Brendan Barber, said bullying was on the rise in the UK.
        "Callers to our helpline have experienced some horrific incidents around bullying that have included humiliation, ostracism, verbal and physical abuse," he said.
        "But managers sometimes dismiss accusations around bullying as simply personality or management-style clashes, whilst others may recognise the problem but lack the confidence or skills to deal with it.

            <header><h3>Alonso win</h3></header>
            The Brazilian Grand Prix will probably not go down as one of the most exciting races in history, but it did provide one memorable moment.

            Fernando Alonso, fresh from another early exit in qualifying following his McLaren's engine failure, decided to make the most of his spare time to grab a marshal's chair and soak up the sun.

            It has been a miserable season for the two-time world champion, who has retired from seven races and finished in the top 10 just twice, but at least he was able to see the funny side.
